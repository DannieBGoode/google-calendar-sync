# Troubleshooting

## The Web UI cannot reach the service

Check `docker compose ps`, then request `http://localhost:8000/health`. Review container logs without posting credentials or event payloads publicly.

## A rule is degraded

Open the incident in the Web UI. Authorization incidents require reauthorizing the affected identity
from Settings. The rule keeps mappings and its last successful incremental positions and performs no
writes while degraded. After reauthorization, choose **Validate recovery** in Rules, inspect the
preview, and enable the rule; its next run repairs drift before advancing either cursor.

## A Google account was disconnected

Open **Settings → Connected accounts** and choose **Reauthorize account** for the same Google
identity. The installation no longer retains credentials for a disconnected account, and enabled
rules that reference it remain degraded. After reauthorization, open Rules, choose **Validate
recovery**, inspect the preview, and enable each affected rule. Existing mappings, Managed
Projections, and incremental positions are preserved throughout recovery.

To remove the local identity permanently, choose **Delete account** and review the destructive
confirmation. Permanent deletion removes every affected Directional Sync Rule and its mappings,
cursors, incidents, and audit activity. Existing Managed Projections are not deleted from Google
Calendar and will no longer be managed. Unrelated accounts and rules are unchanged.

## Google Calendar permission was not granted

The OAuth callback returns to **Settings → Connected accounts** without saving an account. Choose
**Try again**, select the intended Google identity, and grant both calendar-list and event access.
Calendar Sync verifies those permissions before it stores the Connected Account. Declining consent
does not create an account or retain Google credentials.

## A connected account fails Check access

The Google Calendar API is enabled on the Google Cloud project, not separately on each Google
identity. Confirm that the API remains enabled for the project owning the OAuth client, then choose
**Reauthorize account** for the affected identity. **Check access** verifies both calendar-list and
event access through read-only requests. A successful check also reports the number of writable
calendars; an account with zero writable calendars can be a Source Calendar but cannot provide a
Destination Calendar.

## Destination edits return

This is expected. Destination events are Managed Projections and source content is authoritative.
Pause the rule before changing a destination projection that should temporarily remain untouched.

## A destination event was recreated

Deleting a Managed Projection is Drift while its source remains eligible. Synchronization recreates
it on the next destination change poll. Delete or exclude the source, or pause the rule instead.

## Incremental cursor expired

The Google adapter must discard the expired cursor, perform a safe initial-window scan, match managed projections through origin metadata, and establish a new cursor without duplicating events.
