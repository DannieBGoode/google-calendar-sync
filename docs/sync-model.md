# Synchronization model

## Initial and incremental synchronization

The first run selects source events ending no earlier than 30 days before the run, with no future
cutoff, and observes the destination endpoint. A successful initial run establishes separate opaque
incremental cursors for source and destination. Later runs request both change feeds every five
minutes or through Sync Now. Source changes project forward; mapped destination changes load their
authoritative source and repair edits or deletions during that same run.

For each changed source event, the decision service chooses one action:

- **Create** when an eligible source has no managed projection or the mapped projection is missing.
- **Update** whenever actual destination content differs from the projection derived from source authority.
- **Delete** when a mapped source is cancelled or becomes excluded by rule policy.
- **Ignore** when content is current, the source is itself managed, or an excluded/cancelled source has no mapping.
- **Conflict** only when identity or ownership is ambiguous.

## Loop prevention

Managed Google events carry private extended properties containing rule, source, and operation identity. A reverse rule ignores any event bearing managed origin metadata. This permits `A -> B` and `B -> A` while native events flow in both directions without projection loops.

## Recurrence

The domain preserves iCalendar recurrence and occurrence identity at the Google boundary, but the
current pre-alpha synchronization policy excludes recurring series and occurrence exceptions.
Projecting only the series or only an exception can duplicate or resurrect occurrences, and timed
series also require provider timezone identity across daylight-saving changes. The system therefore
fails closed until series-to-series and occurrence-to-occurrence mapping is implemented.

## Partial failure

Provider writes use stable Operation Keys. Each acknowledged provider operation commits its mapping
and audit evidence in a short SQLite transaction, while both incremental cursors advance only after
the complete source and destination batches succeed. A retry can therefore reuse completed mappings
without losing its safe position. Temporary failures retry with exponential backoff and jitter.
Three consecutive scheduled failures open one deduplicated incident.

## Reconciliation

Touched mappings reconcile before a run completes. A Full Reconciliation runs daily and through Reconcile Now. It derives expected projections from current sources, fetches managed destination state independently, and reports missing, unexpected, incorrect, or inconsistent mappings. Drift repairs automatically; conflicts require intervention.
